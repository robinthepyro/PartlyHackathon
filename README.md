# GROUP 4 PARTLY HACKATHON

### ⚡ Challenge 2: Express Parts Assessment

Imagine a dismantler standing in front of a crashed car. They have minutes, maybe seconds, to scan it and record what's garbage (too damaged to sell) and what's gold (undamaged and sellable). 

Your challenge is to build something that makes this process lightning-fast. How can we create a super intuitive way for someone to "point" at a car (or a digital model of it) and instantly tag parts for sale or for scrap? This is all about **speed and flow**. How quickly can a user get the job done?

Think in time scales of max ~60-120 seconds for a single vehicle.
